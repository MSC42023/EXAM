To install and configure Go Ethereum (Geth) and the Themis Browser, and develop and test a sample application with MetaMask and Remix, you can follow the steps below:

Install Go Ethereum (Geth):

Download the latest stable version of Geth from the official Geth repository: https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/
Choose the appropriate package for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and download it.
Install Geth by following the instructions provided for your specific operating system.
Configure Geth:

Once Geth is installed, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where Geth is installed.
Create a new directory to store the blockchain data: mkdir blockchain
Initialize the Geth node with the following command: geth --datadir blockchain init genesis.json
(Note: You need to have a genesis.json file with the configuration for your private Ethereum network. You can create one using tools like puppeth or use an existing configuration.)
Start Geth:

Start the Geth node with the following command: geth --datadir blockchain --rpc --rpcapi eth,web3,personal --rpcaddr "localhost" --rpcport 8545 --rpccorsdomain "*" --networkid 1234
(Modify the --networkid parameter with your desired network ID. Also, adjust the --rpcaddr and --rpcport if needed.)
Install Themis Browser:

Visit the Themis Browser GitHub repository: https://github.com/ConsenSys/themis
Follow the installation instructions provided in the repository's README.md file to install the Themis Browser.
Develop and Test the Sample Application:

Open the Themis Browser and navigate to Remix (https://remix.ethereum.org/).
Write your Solidity smart contract in the Remix IDE.
Connect MetaMask to the Themis Browser by following the MetaMask setup instructions provided by MetaMask (https://metamask.io/).
Deploy your smart contract using Remix and interact with it using MetaMask.
These steps should guide you through the installation, configuration, and development process using Go Ethereum, the Themis Browser, MetaMask, and Remix. Remember to adjust the commands and configurations based on your specific needs and requirements.
